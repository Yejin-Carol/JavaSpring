- Spring Weekly Study (since Nov, 2021)

- Study Procedures

  - When? 10 am every Sunday
  - How?
    Basically, we have 100 mission questions about Spring MVC Framework and each one of us gives a 10-minute presentation every week after solving some and ask a professional developer some questions .
  - People pay KRW 40,000 before joining the study and an organizer (professional developer) pays us back KRW 10,000 (or plus more from those missed the study week. No Excuses Accepted) after finishing each week's Zoom gathering.
  - It's always helpful to see other participants' codes.

- Process
  - Week1 (7th of Nov): I was only able to finish Mission 01 and 02. It's about initializing a MVC project by adding simple Controller(@RequestMapping) with view (.jsp)
  - Week2 (14th of Nov): Mission 03 ~ 05 are about mapping Request Path in BoardController. I was able to know better how to map a spring controller by using different types of path, http method, Params mapping.
  - Week3 (21st of Nov): Mission 06 ~ 12 I struggled to figure out how ajax works in JSP file. And I was guided to study more on jQuery with some contents from 생활코딩.
  - Week4 (28th of Nov): Mission 13 ~ 17. I was able to finish the presentation about the ajax. And I found out that the problem was made from the bad dependency injection.
